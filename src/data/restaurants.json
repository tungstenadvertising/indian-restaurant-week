        "chefBio": "I was born and raised in Kolkata, in a humble farming family. My roots are deep in the soil - quite literally. As a child, I would often run errands for my mother, like picking fresh carrots or tomatoes straight from our farm. Those moments of connecting with the land gave me immense joy, but they also planted a deeper understanding in me-that harvesting a crop is not the end; it's just the beginning of a much larger vision. That vision shaped my path in life. I always loved cooking for family and friends during gatherings and special occasions. After completing my education in Kolkata, I set out on a new journey-to the Culinary Academy of India in Hyderabad, under the guidance of my mentor and brother, Chef Sujan. Stepping into that academy opened a whole new world for me. I learned not just how to cook, but how to create. I began to understand that a dish is more than just food-it's a reflection of who you are, a story you tell through flavors and techniques. After graduation, my journey took me across the world. I joined the Princess Cruise Line in the United States, boarding in Los Angeles.",
